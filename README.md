# The Farm Hand App

### The app for farm staff to track the chores and news of a working farm —  i.e. a farm whose agricultural land and buildings are in active use for crop production and/or the raising of livestock.

### The Need:
With a team on rotating schedules that tend to the daily care of multiple breeds of animals (sheep, goats, cattle, donkeys, chickens, pigs) at multiple locations on a farm, there’s always a lot going on and constant updates/changes — and it’s hard to keep everyone up-to-date just through email and texts. 

### Solution:
The Farm Hand App solves this. As a mobile-friendly and easy-to-use application, staff members can easily access daily chores and news/updates in one place at the beginning of each work day.
